📊 **Power BI Dashboard Summary**: United Kingdom Road Accident Analysis

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of road accidents in the United Kingdom, focusing on casualties, accident trends, vehicle involvement, and road surface conditions. The insights help identify high-risk areas, seasonal patterns, and contributing factors to support data-driven road-safety planning.

**1. 🚗 Total Accidents & Casualties Overview**
Total number of accidents recorded across the UK within the selected time frame.
Total casualties, split into:
Fatal casualties
Serious casualties
Slight casualties
Year-over-year (YoY) trends highlight whether accidents and casualties are increasing or decreasing.

**2. 📈 Accident Trend Analysis**
A line or area chart shows:
Monthly or yearly accident trends
High-accident months (often winter months due to poor weather)
Any visible pattern of reduction/improvement due to safety programs or traffic law changes.

**3. 🚘 Accidents by Vehicle Type**
Cars
Motorcycles
Bicycles
Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs)
Buses / Public transport
Other vehicles

**Key observations include:**
Cars usually represent the highest share of accidents.
Motorcyclists show a higher proportion of serious/fatal casualties relative to accident count.
Cyclists show increased risk in urban centres.

**4. 🌧️ Road Surface Type Analysis**
Visual comparing accidents occurring on:
Dry roads
Wet roads
Snow/Ice-covered roads
Flooded or greasy surfaces

**Insights:**
Majority of accidents occur on dry roads due to higher traffic volume.
Wet and icy surfaces correlate with higher severity.
Seasonal filters show risk spikes in rainy and winter seasons.

**5. 📍 Geographic Hotspot Map**
UK map showing accident hotspots by region, city.

**6. 🔍 Filtering & Drill-Down Capabilities**
Users can filter accidents by:
Road Surface / Weather Conditions / Rural or Urban / City-Area etc.
Light conditions (Day/Night)
Vehicle type
Casualty severity

**7. 🧩 Key Insights & Recommendations**
Peak accident periods identified for targeted awareness campaigns.
Vehicle categories
Road surfaces requiring improved signage or resurfacing.
Regions needing additional enforcement or safety measures.

**🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used**
1. Power BI Desktop Used for: Data modeling, Creating visuals, Applying DAX calculations, Building interactive dashboards
2. Power Query (M Language) Used for: Data extraction, Data cleaning, Data transformation, Merging and shaping datasets
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Used for: Creating measures (Total Accidents, YoY %, Fatality Rate, etc.), Calculated tables, Time intelligence, KPI logic
4. Data Sources: CSV / Excel files (from UK accident statistics)
5. Power BI Service Used for: Publishing the report, Refresh scheduling, Sharing and permissions, Dashboard creation (tiles, alerts)
6. Visualization Tools / Features: Map visuals (filled map, shape map), Line charts, bar charts, donut charts, KPI cards, Slicers (filters), Bookmarks for storytelling, Tooltip pages

📌 **Conclusion**
The dashboard integrates multiple tools—Power BI Desktop, DAX, Power Query, cloud storage, and map analytics—to provide a complete, interactive view of UK road safety trends. 
It equips policymakers, analysts, and safety departments with insights to improve road and traffic management.
